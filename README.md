**Development** at Sourceduty is the foundation of its digital innovation. It involves creating software, digital art pipelines, interactive applications, and backend systems that power the company’s creative and technical output. The development process begins with ideation and planning, moves into design and coding, and continues through testing and iteration. At Sourceduty, development is more than writing code—it’s about crafting efficient, scalable, and visually impressive solutions that meet both artistic and technical standards. This includes building custom scripts for 3D workflows, API integrations for automation, and interactive experiences for games or virtual platforms. Sourceduty's developers often leverage custom GPTs like **[OS Developer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-2Ucol4HeB-os-developer)** to simulate or deploy production environments, debug shell-level issues, and configure development tools more efficiently.

**DevOps** at Sourceduty ensures that all development efforts move smoothly from code to deployment without friction. It encompasses infrastructure management, CI/CD pipelines, version control, testing automation, and release management. The goal of DevOps in this context is to reduce the time between writing code and delivering value to users or internal teams. Tools like GitHub Actions, Docker, and cloud orchestration systems are crucial, enabling developers and artists to deploy and iterate on their work reliably. Sourceduty integrates AI-enhanced systems like the **[Developer Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6813dc82860881919f01747f981ae0ed-developer-assistant)** GPT to help streamline configurations, generate scripts, monitor logs, and even write container definitions or CI configurations. This fusion of DevOps and AI ensures consistent performance, shortens deployment cycles, and reduces manual overhead.

**Tools for development** at Sourceduty are carefully selected to meet the demands of hybrid creative-technical workflows. For software, this includes traditional IDEs like Visual Studio Code, version control via Git, and platform-specific SDKs. For 3D and digital content creation, the team integrates tools like Blender, Unity, and Substance Painter—often augmented with custom Python scripts to enhance automation. Sourceduty also builds and deploys internal dashboards, GPT-powered tools, and web utilities that enable non-technical team members to interact with systems easily. Using the OS Developer and Developer Assistant GPTs, Sourceduty developers can quickly access documentation, troubleshoot issues, and manage environments without breaking flow. These tools, combined with AI-assisted development practices, allow Sourceduty to keep its production agile, collaborative, and continuously improving.
